A GitHub Action to log-in into your [LocalStack account](https://app.localstack.cloud) on your GitHub Actions runner workflow by specifying your Email Address and Password. See the [LocalStack Documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/localstack-cli-manual/#login) for an explanation of a log in using `localstack` CLI, which this action wraps.

## Usage

To get started, you can use this minimal example:

```yaml
- name: ü§î Login to LocalStack
  uses: LocalStack/localstack-github-actions-login@v0.1.0
  with:
    email: ${{ secrets.LOCALSTACK_USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.LOCALSTACK_PASSWORD }}
```

### Inputs

| Input      | Description                                                          | Default |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `email`    | Email address with which you have configured your LocalStack account | None    |
| `password` | Password with which you authenticate your LocalStack account         | None    |

### Example Workflow

This example workflow will pull the latest version of [LocalStack Pro](https://hub.docker.com/r/localstack/localstack-pro) image with an API key configured in the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` secret. It will then pull a log-in using the `LOCALSTACK_USERNAME` and `LOCALSTACK_PASSWORD` secrets. Finally, it will pull a [Cloud Pod](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/cloud-pods/) available in your [LocalStack account](https://app.localstack.cloud).
